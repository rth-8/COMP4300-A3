Assets def file
    - 3 types

Texture N P

	N = name std::string
	P = path std::string

    example: Texture AAA path/to/imageAAA.png


Animation N T F S

	N = name
	T = texture	std::string	- name define in Texture (see above)
	F = frame count	int
	S = speed	int	- number of game frames between animation frames


Font N P

	N = name	std::string
	P = path

	(- similar to Texture)


Note: animations can be repeating or non-repeating

Entity position is center of its rect shape ! Same for bounding box !

Entity must have CAnimation component
	- to calculate center point

'P'     toggle pause game
'T'     toggle drawing textures
'C'     toggle drawing bounding boxes
'G'     toggle drawing grid
'ESC'   back

level specification

tile type: 
        "Tile"   = solid block
        "Dec"    = decoration (no collisions)
        "Player" = player spec

Tile A GX GY

    A  = associated animation (sprite)   std::string
    GX = grid x     float
    GY = grid y     float
    
Dec A X Y
    ...
    
    
Player GX GY CW CH SX SY SM GR B

    GX, GY  = float, float  = start pos
    CW, CH  = --//--        = bounding box size
    SX      = float         = horiz speed
    SY      = --//--        = vert speed
    SM      = float         = max speed
    GR      = float         = gravity
    B       = std::string   = Bullet animation
    
    
 
NOTE: grid blocks are 64x64 px
